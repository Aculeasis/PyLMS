Player Class (pylms.player.Player)
============================================

The Player class allows individual control of any Logitech Media Server compatible
devices that are connected and registered with the server.

Any function calls made by the Player are communicated to the Logitech Media Server Telnet server
via the parent Server (pylms.server.Server) class.
